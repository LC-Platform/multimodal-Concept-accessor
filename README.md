# multimodal-Concept-accessor

This repository is dedicated to the **multimodal-Concept-accessor** project, which involves handling and processing multimodal data (text, audio, video) for concept extraction and related tasks.

I will be updating this repository regularly with details about the project, the sub-tasks completed, and ongoing work across different branches.

Please explore the respective branches for better understanding of the module-wise development and progress.
